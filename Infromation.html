<h1>Malware<h1>
<p> Certain strains of malware are easier to detect than others. Some, like ransomware and adware, make their presence known immediately, either by encrypting your files or by streaming endless ads at you. Others, like Trojans and spyware, go out of their way to hide from you as long as possible, meaning they could be on your system a long time before you realize that theyâ€™re present. And then there are others, like viruses and worms, that might operate in secret for a time, before the symptoms of their infection start to appear, such as freezing, deleted or replaced files, sudden shutdowns, or a hyperactive processor. The only surefire way to detect all malware before it infects your PC, Mac, or mobile is to install anti-malware software, which will come packaged with detection tools and scans that can catch malware currently on your device, as well as block malware trying to infect it.<p>
